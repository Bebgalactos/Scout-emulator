# S'argo
## Information
S'argo is a Discord bot using the Discord4J API wrapper.

This Discord bot's main use is to be a "summon simulator" for the mobile game *Sword Art Online: Memory Defrag*.

## Usage
S'argo was not built to have self-hosting in mind, so support won't be given.

To start the bot: insert your bot's token in data/Settings.xml under the **token** section.  
You can then run the code to start the bot. There is no GUI or anything, so if you decide  
to make an executable .jar file with this code, you'll have to terminate the java process in  
task manager to stop the bot.

## Features
As of now, S'argo only has the basic scout feature down with two available banners  
to pull from. Saved player data and stats coming soon so stay tuned.

## Commands
S'argo is called by mentioning your bot before the command.  
Replace '@mention' with '@your_bot_name'.  
If your bot is nicknamed, it will not be called.

- **SCOUTING**  
'@mention **scout**' - View all available banners.  
'@mention **scout** [banner ID]' - View banner information.  
'@mention **scout** [banner ID] [single | multi]' - Scout a banner.
